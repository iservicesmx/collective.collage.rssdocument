collective.collage.rssdocument Installation
=======================

 * Add ``iservices.rssdocument`` and ``collective.collage.rssdocument`` to the
   list of eggs to install, e.g.:

    [buildout]
    ...
    eggs =
        ...
        iservices.rssdocument
        collective.collage.rssdocument

  * Tell the plone.recipe.zope2instance recipe to install a ZCML slug:

    [instance]
    recipe = plone.recipe.zope2instance
    ...
    zcml =
        collective.collage.rssdocument

  * Re-run buildout, e.g. with:

    $ ./bin/buildout

You can skip the ZCML slug if you are going to explicitly include the package
from another package's configure.zcml file.
